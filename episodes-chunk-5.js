Bread is an important ingredient here. You need to remember one thing -choose the bread according to the following criteria :freshness, crumb and color.

I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich."},{"speaker":"A","text":"Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and  light. The best choices here are evident- cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, sweet pepper pepper or chilli, lettuce and, of course, herbs- you can't go wrong with them. As for aubergines, mushrooms and asparagus, I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil."},{"speaker":"A","text":"Last but not least, we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich.  We can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper, or we can combine mustard sauce, mayonnaise, ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor! It's always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt!"},{"speaker":"A","text":"That's all the time we have for today, but join us next time where we'll be going over how to make the perfect lasagna!
