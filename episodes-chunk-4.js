After this incident, strange things would happen in the house and my aunt would yell and scream, according to her, warding off the evil that had come to get her.  As the days passed, she became very weak and eventually was unable to talk.  My dad had to work during the day, so I was left to care for her.  When she lost her voice and laid on her death bed, I would hear her breathe, in and out."},{"speaker":"B","text":"Until finally one day, she breathed in... and never exhaled.

The following morning, I went to the bathroom, expecting to find a mess and everything torn up, but I found everything exactly as it was before.  The movers came that same day and as we were cleaning out her drawers and personal items, we found strange notebooks with names and amounts of money written next to them. We found pictures with people's faces sewn with black or red string.  And you want to know what the strangest thing was? There was a small doll, filled with dead ants, with a strand of hair tied around it's waist, and on the doll's face, there was a picture of me with the numbers: \"311009\".
