I never really understood what that is, but I know it has to do with sex or something."},{"speaker":"A","text":"Good point Jason! This will be the topic of our first class, contraceptives. As you mentioned, the pill is one of the many that exist.  The birth control pill is taken daily by a woman in order to prevent unwanted pregnancy, but it does not protect her from contracting STD's from an infected person. Another popular method is using condoms. This is probably the best method if you have sex, since it not only prevents a woman from getting pregnant but also protects both from STD's. Yes Jason?"},{"speaker":"B","text":"What are condoms made out of?

Many of you may think you already know how babies come to be, but I am sure that some of the things that we will be talking about today may surprise you. Billy can you turn on the projector please? Thanks. Ok, does anyone know what this is?"},{"speaker":"B","text":"Looks like a goat head to me!"},{"speaker":"A","text":"Nice try, but this is a woman’s womb which contains her uterus and ovaries. The ovaries. are packed with eggs and each month during the middle of the menstrual cycle, the ripest one will be sucked up by one of the fallopian tubes. This is called ovulation and the exact time of ovulation depends on the length of your cycle. In an average 28 day cycle, ovulation will most likely happen between the 12th and 15th days, counting day 1 as the first day of your last period."},{"speaker":"B","text":"That's amazing! So each month, the woman produces these eggs and then waits for them to be fertilized?"},{"speaker":"A","text":"Actually, every woman is already born with over four hundred thousand eggs! Some will start dying off immediately and others released during her fertile period."},{"speaker":"B","text":"What about the guys? I know they produce sperm and stuff."},{"speaker":"A","text":"That’s right! The man’s body has a tiny factory that produces sperm twenty four hours a day! Each ejaculation will release about a hundred million sperm  so the factory is always pretty busy. The sole purpose of a sperm's life is to fertilize the woman's egg."},{"speaker":"B","text":"So, then we basically need to put one-and-one together so we can have babies right?"},{"speaker":"A","text":"Yes, the man will have an orgasm during intercourse and ejaculate sperm and semen. Now this is where the race begins and all those millions of sperm will race and swim from the cervix, through the uterus to the fallopian tubes. This could take anywhere from forty five minutes to twelve hours! Not all of them make it, since some go the wrong way and get lost or simply die. Many will actually reach the egg but only one will penetrate it and fertilize it. Once this happens, the egg instantly changes and creates a protective shield once the sperm is safely inside."},{"speaker":"B","text":"And then? That's it?"},{"speaker":"A","text":"Well, the egg will be fertilized within about 24 hours of its release. The genetic material from the sperm combines with the genetic material in the egg to create a new cell that will rapidly start dividing. The woman is not actually pregnant until that bundle of new cells, known as the embryo, travels the rest of the way down the fallopian tube and attaches itself to the wall of her uterus.

Then let's move on."}],"vocabData":{"key":[{"word":"womb","type":"phrase","definition":"the uterus of the human female"},{"word":"ovulation","type":"phrase","definition":"the discharge of a mature ovum from the ovary"},{"word":"ejaculation","type":"phrase","definition":"the discharge of semen by the male reproductive organs"},{"word":"embryo","type":"phrase","definition":"in humans, the young in the early stages of development within the womb"},{"word":"wall","type":"phrase","definition":"the outermost layer defining the physical limits of an object"}],"supplementary":[{"word":"urethra","type":"phrase","definition":"the part of the male anatomy which transports semen"},{"word":"vas deferens","type":"phrase","definition":"the specific tube which semen travel through"},{"word":"scrotum","type":"phrase","definition":"a pouch with holds the testes"},{"word":"pre menstrual syndrome","type":"phrase","definition":"a disorder during a woman's menstrual cycle characterized by depression and stomach cramps"},{"word":"vagina","type":"phrase","definition":"the female reproductive organ"}]}},{"id":256,"title":"Interview Skills 8 - Discussing Salary and Benefits","level":"The Office","mp3":"/audio/englishpod_0256pb.mp3","transcript":"https://ia600408.us.archive.org/10/items/englishpod_all/englishpod_0256.html","transcriptData":[],"vocabData":{"key":[{"word":"remuneration package","type":"phrase","definition":"money and benefits given to someone for the work"},{"word":"per annum","type":"phrase","definition":"each year"},{"word":"housing allowance","type":"phrase","definition":"money that a company provides for rent of a house"},{"word":"flexible","type":"phrase","definition":"able to change or to do different things"},{"word":"go through","type":"phrase","definition":"to study or look at (something) in a careful way"}],"supplementary":[{"word":"Gross","type":"phrase","definition":"Overall sum excluding tax and any deductions"},{"word":"Net","type":"phrase","definition":"Free from all charges or deductions"},{"word":"Income Tax","type":"phrase","definition":"A tax on the amount of money you earn"},{"word":"Stock Options","type":"phrase","definition":"A benefit offered by a company to purchase stock for a fixed price"},{"word":"Bonus","type":"phrase","definition":"An additional payment or reward given for good work or performance"}]}},{"id":257,"title":"The World Cup","level":"Global View","mp3":"/audio/englishpod_0257pb.mp3","transcript":"https://ia600408.us.archive.org/10/items/englishpod_all/englishpod_0257.html","transcriptData":[{"speaker":"A","text":"What are you doing?"},{"speaker":"B","text":"What am I doing?
